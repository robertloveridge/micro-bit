# micro-bit

A micro:bit has the following physical features:

 * 25 individually-programmable LEDs
 * 2 programmable buttons
 * Physical connection pins
 * Light and temperature sensors
 * Motion sensors (accelerometer and compass)
 * Wireless Communication, via Radio and Bluetooth
 * USB interface

Their official website has a really good [overview of each feature](https://microbit.org/guide/features/).

I haven't really made use of it yet but I'm planning on making a robot for my 3 year old son, so some of the motion sensor features will probably come in handy for that.
